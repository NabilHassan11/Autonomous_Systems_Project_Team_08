#Autonomous Systems Project Team 08

# 🚀 Milestone 2 - 

## 📌 Overview
Milestone 2 focuses on advancing the autonomous system with enhancements in software, simulation, and real-world testing. This phase includes crucial improvements in **teleoperation**, **OLR (Open Loop Response)**, and system integration.

## 📁 Project Structure
The following key components are included in this milestone:

- **`python_scripts/`**: Contains essential scripts for teleoperation and OLR.
- **`launch/`**: Houses the necessary launch files for initializing the system.
- **Additional components**: Any supplementary configurations, ROS packages, or dependencies required for smooth operation.

# 📜 Milestone 1 Deliverables
For reference, the deliverables from Milestone 1 can be found in the following directories:

- **Hardware Deliverables:** Located in  
  📂 `Autonomous_Systems_Project_Team_08/Milestone1/Hardware_Milestone_01_Team_08/`
- **Simulation Deliverables:** Located in  
  📂 `Autonomous_Systems_Project_Team_08/Milestone1/Simulation_Milestone_01_Team_08/`

These directories contain all the necessary resources, including **hardware setup instructions for the Raspberry Pi 4B** and **simulation-based deliverables** from the first milestone.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Fine-tune the teleoperation and OLR functionalities.
- Validate performance through both **simulation** and **real-world testing**.
- Prepare documentation and further refinements for the next milestone.
